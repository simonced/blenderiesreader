# Introduction #
You'll find here some tips and informations about how to use this library.

**Note** : this library is still under development.

# Basic usage #

From a python program:
```
#First you need to include the lib in your script:
from iesreader1995 import *

#Then you can instanciate it:
ies = iesReader(*path to your ies file here*)
```

From blender, it's a bit tricky:
```
import Blender
import bpy
from Blender import *

#to make python look into the same directory as the blend file
blendPath = Blender.sys.expandpath('//')
import sys
sys.path.append(blendPath)
from iesreader1995 import *

#Then you can instanciate it:
ies = iesReader(*name to your ies file here*)
```


# Methods #

The library provides several methods to use or extract data:

## debug() ##
Allows to display the object content and data imported from the ies.

## get(**attribute**) ##
_This function can do many things._
If the file format is an IES: _get('version')_ returns "LM-63-1995"
> It gets the associated ies header element. It is the lines with **`[xxx] yyy`**.
> Supply **xxx** as parameter to the function and **yyy** is returned if the data exist.
> All data of the IES out of the header are also accessible here. Refer to the table below for the list.
If the file format is a EU: _get('version')_ returns "EU"
> All data of the EU header are accessible here. Refer to the table below for the list.

## getOrthoCoords() ##
Converts the IES / EU candela values into a list of rectangular coordinates.
The order of the data returned will be the SAME for all formats, even if these data are in a different order from the file read.
See details bellow.

## getMultipliedCandela(cv**) : float ##
This method returns the candela value _cv_** with the factor **multiplier** applied.
Note:
Only for IES at the moment. Patch ready to take a similar value in consideration for the EU std.
**This method is still under developpement as the source of the multiplier in the ies file is not clear yet.**

# Attributes #
## For IES ##
| **Attribute Name** | **Usage** |
|:-------------------|:----------|
| data | A dictionary containing the key:values of the header. Lines with `[`xxx`]` yyy data are inserted here. |
| version | The first line version is memorized here. **ONLY 1995 format is supported at the moment!** |
| tilt | The tilt content from the ies file : NONE, INCLUDE or FILE. |
| multiplier | The coefficient to be applied to the candela values.Used in the **getMultipliedCandela()** method. |
| unit\_type | feet or meters |
| photometric\_type | A,B or C |
| vertical\_angles\_count | Number of vertical angles. |
| horizontal\_angles\_count | Number of the horizontal angles. |
| vertical\_angles | List of the vertical angles. |
| horizontal\_angles | List of the horizontal angles. |
| candelas\_values | List of the candela values. **It's a flat list, has to be parsed together with the horizontal and vertical angles values to get sense. But you may not need to do it yourself.See details bellow.**|
| ready | Once the file is parsed and all the candela values in memory, this attribute turns to True. |
| lamps\_number | Number of lamps. |
| lamp\_lumens | Lumens per lamp. |
| lamp\_watts | Lamp watt input. |
| width | The width, info contained on the same line as the global informations. (types, angles...) |
| length | The length, info contained on the same line as the global informations. (types, angles...) |
| height | The height, info contained on the same line as the global informations. (types, angles...) |
| ballast\_factor | The ballast factor. |

## For EU ##
| **Attribute Name** | **Usage** |
|:-------------------|:----------|
| company | name of the company |
| ityp | type indicator |
| isym | symmetry |
| mc | number of C planes / accessible by **vertical\_angles\_count** too |
| dc | distance => float |
| ng | number of luminous intensities in each C plane / accessible by **horizontal\_angles\_count** too |
| dg | distance between C planes |
| repnum | report number |
| lumname | luminaire name |
| lumnumb | luminaire number |
| filename | file name |
| dateuser | date / user |
| l1 | length / Diameter |
| w1 | width |
| h1 | height |
| ldlum | length / diameter of luminous area |
| b1 | width of luminous area |
| hlumc0 | height of luminous area C plane 0 |
| hlumc90 | height of luminous area C plane 90 |
| hlumc180 | height of luminous area C plane 180 |
| hlumc270 | height of luminous area C plane 270 |
| dff | downward flux fraction % |
| lorl | light output ratio luminaire % |
| convfactor | conversion factor for luminous intensity |
| tiltlum | tilt of luminaire during measurement |
| nstd | number of std sets of lamps |

# Linearized data access #

Here is a picture to try to explain the linearization system, hope it's clear enough :-s

Note: Seems to need to be uploaded again... Need corrections anyway... TODO
